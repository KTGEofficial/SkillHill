# SkillHill
This is where I put all of my Skill Hill code. The code can be used for free if you credit me. I'm also a horrible Python scripter. I can only script in Lua, so all of my Python scripts here are originally Lua scripts, but then I used the website codeconvert.ai, so that the Lua scripts would be converted to Python.
